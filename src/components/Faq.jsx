                        <p>React.js is a popular open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications (SPAs). It allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes. React uses a declarative approach, making it easier to reason about your application and manage its state.

                            Key Features of React.js:
                            Declarative UI: React makes it easy to create interactive UIs by designing simple views for each state in your application.
                            Component-Based Architecture: The UI is broken down into reusable components, each managing its own state, which helps in building complex UIs from simple building blocks.
                            Virtual DOM: React maintains a virtual representation of the DOM, enabling efficient updates and rendering. When a component's state changes, React updates only the parts of the DOM that need to change, improving performance.

                    <div className="collapse-title text-xl font-medium">What is JSX in React, and how does it work?</div>
                    <div className="collapse-content">
                        <p>JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript commonly used in React to describe the structure of user interfaces. It allows developers to write HTML-like syntax directly within their JavaScript code, making it easier to visualize the UI and maintain the structure of the components.

                            Key Features of JSX
                            HTML-Like Syntax: JSX looks similar to HTML, which makes it intuitive for developers familiar with web technologies. For example, you can write a component's structure using tags:
                            JavaScript Expressions: You can embed JavaScript expressions within curly braces { } inside JSX. This allows dynamic rendering of content:
                            Attributes: JSX allows you to pass attributes to elements using camelCase syntax for properties. For example, className is used instead of class because class is a reserved keyword in JavaScript:
                            Children: You can nest elements inside one another, allowing for the creation of complex UIs:

                    <div className="collapse-content">
                        <p>The Virtual DOM is a crucial feature of React that enhances performance and efficiency in managing UI updates. By maintaining a lightweight representation of the DOM and using a diffing algorithm to determine changes, React minimizes direct interactions with the real DOM, resulting in faster updates and a better overall user experience. This design allows developers to focus on building their applications without having to manage the complexities of DOM manipulation directly.</p>

                    <div className="collapse-content">
                        <p>Props are an essential concept in React that facilitate the flow of data between components. They allow you to create dynamic, reusable components by passing data and event handlers from parent to child components. Since props are immutable within child components, they promote a unidirectional data flow, which helps in maintaining predictable application behavior. By leveraging props effectively, you can build modular and maintainable React applications.</p>

                    <div className="collapse-content">
                        <p>In summary, state in React is a way for components to manage their own data that can change over time, allowing for dynamic and interactive UIs. While props are used for passing data and functions between components, state is localized to the component itself and can be modified by it. Understanding the distinction between state and props is fundamental to building effective React applications.</p>
